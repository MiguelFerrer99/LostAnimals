# LostAnimals

LostAnimals is a native mobile app idea for iOS, which will be aimed at helping people who have lost their pet. 

Its main objective is to give the user the availability of being able to share which pet they have lost, where and when, in order that it becomes known and its owner can find it. In the same way, a user will be able to share information about whether they have found a lost or abandoned pet.  All these functions may contain date and location filters, so that it is much easier to find pets near you.  

In addition, the application will allow some functions such as being able to contact users quickly and efficiently through their social networks.
